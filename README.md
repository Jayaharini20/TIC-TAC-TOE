# TIC-TAC-TOE
A simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game written in Python.
This project is a simple, console-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, developed entirely in Python. It allows two players to take turns placing their marks (X and O) on a 3×3 grid, aiming to align three marks in a row — horizontally, vertically, or diagonally — before their opponent does.

The game begins with an empty board and prompts each player to choose their move by entering a position number corresponding to the grid. Input validation ensures that players cannot choose an already occupied spot or enter invalid positions. After each move, the board is updated and displayed, showing the game’s current state. The program automatically checks for win conditions after every turn and announces the winner. If all spots are filled without a winner, the game declares a draw.

This project is designed with clean, beginner-friendly Python code and uses basic programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, functions, and lists. It is a great starting point for learning game logic, user input handling, and structured programming.
